# React Financial Charts

> **Note:** this repo is a fork of [react-stockcharts](https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts), renamed, converted to typescript and bug fixes applied due to the original project being unmaintained.

> **Note:** v1 is a fully breaking change with large parts, if not all, rewritten. Do not expect the same API! although the same features should exist.
